    <p>Cornbread stuffing is the secret ingredient in this cheesy baked Mexican ground beef casserole, also featuring diced tomatoes with jalapeno, chili powder, cumin, hot sauce, canned sweet corn, and Cheddar. "Nice and easy dinner," says fabeveryday, who rates it five stars. "I added seasoning salt and garlic powder to the meat, since I wanted a little something extra. Delicious topped with a bit of sour cream.</p>
